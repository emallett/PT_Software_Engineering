//create the game tic-tac-toe- what are some stories that we want to make sure we cover?

The game of tic-tac-toe is as old as the day, fun, and simple.  Through a web application I would want to mimic those charictaristics//

/* the grid of tic-tac-toe will be the familiar two crosses down, two lines across- the pattern will be wood, and the font will be 
'old western'.  There will be the option of picking a circle <red> or picking a square <blue>.

the first player will pick either circle or square and proceed to make the first move (let's say the center); the second player takes their turn
and the players  alternate from first until last until a person has three (3) of their 'x' or 'o' across.
The winner then gets a point on the bottom of their screen and proceeds to pick either first space in the next round or let the 
other player go first */
